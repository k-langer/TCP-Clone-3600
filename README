We implemented a basic sliding window protocol with a configurable send timeout, receive timeout, and window size. With just these implemented, we were able to achieve good speed, but excessive unnecessary data was transmitted. We attempted adjustable timeouts and slow start/congestion avoidance/fast retransmit, but we were not able to tune these features to enhance performance. Some tests improved but others suffered and even failed. A packet cache the size of the window was implemented on both the send and receive side. The sender caches every packet it sends in case it needs to retransmit. We never re-read data from the file. The receiver caches in case it receives packets out of order. When it receives an earlier packet, it can "ack forward" to avoid unnecessary retransmissions.
